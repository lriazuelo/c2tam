In no particular order 

	Exceptions in o2buffer
	Exceptions in dvbuffer

	More helper functions for diskbuffer

	mplayerbuffer


	Ethan's algorithms stuff

	Memory leak occurs if an exception is thrown in v4l2buffer after the new in the constructor
	
	More image libraries.


	move EndOfBufferBehaviour in to LocalVideoBuffer base class


	Make imagestreambuffer

	Put dynamic_cast<> type checking in all put_frame()s in all VideoBuffer s

	Fix alpha loading in TIFF images. Currently, the loading loads precomposited and noncomposited images in the same way. Also, it loads alpha as an opacity (1 = opaque) value, whereas the convert_pixel stuff treats aplha as transparency (0 = opaque). This needs to be fixed.

Done
	There is a FIXME in videofilebuffer.cc to be fixed
	Colourspace buffer
	Templated v4l2buffer
	Working v4l2buffer for 2.6
	Prevent JPEG loader from trashing the next one in the stream
	Auto configuration
	JPEG saving
	Get .so to work with exceptions
	MPEG buffer
	General owned image buffer from which one would derive diskbuffer, etc
	Templated MPEG buffer
	Move frames_per_second() in to video buffer base class
	wls_c? fixed.
	Redo configuration, so it is only done once. Autoconf now used.
	v4l1buffer
